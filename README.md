# Terminal WhatsApp

> WhatsApp Web, in your terminal! Even supports mouse interaction!

For those times when you get bored of graphical interfaces and their overly complex interfaces.
Terminal WhatsApp to the rescue! Browse and even send messages, right from your terminal! Even
supports clicking buttons and scrolling lists with your mouse, like the overly complex
official client! Built fully with JavaScript (NodeJS), just like the official WhatsApp web client!

Currently, this project is written with the older API of Baileys, which does not support WhatsApp
Multidevice. I haven't had the time to rewrite it with the new API, but would certainly do that _eventually_.
